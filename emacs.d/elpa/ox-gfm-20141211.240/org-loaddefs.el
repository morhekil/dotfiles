Export current buffer to a Github Flavored Markdown buffer.

If narrowing is active in the current buffer, only export its
narrowed part.

If a region is active, export that region.

A non-nil optional argument ASYNC means the process should happen
asynchronously.  The resulting buffer should be accessible
through the `org-export-stack' interface.

When optional argument SUBTREEP is non-nil, export the sub-tree
at point, extracting information from the headline properties
first.

When optional argument VISIBLE-ONLY is non-nil, don't export
contents of hidden elements.

Export is done in a buffer named \"*Org GFM Export*\", which will
be displayed when `org-export-show-temporary-export-buffer' is
non-nil.
